  if (fillLevel > 0.95) return BinStatus.overflowing;
  if (fillLevel > 0.8) return BinStatus.full;
  return BinStatus.normal;
}
```

### Customizing Map Colors
```dart
Color _getFillColor(double fillLevel) {
  if (fillLevel > 0.95) return Colors.red;
  if (fillLevel > 0.8) return Colors.orange;
  if (fillLevel > 0.5) return Colors.yellow;
  return Colors.green;
}
```
